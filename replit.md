## System Architecture

### Core Bot Architecture
**Main Bot Implementation**: Python-based Discord bot (`bot_unificado_completo.py`) with modular system design featuring comprehensive AI integration, music capabilities, and kawaii personality framework.

**AI Ensemble System**: 
- Multi-provider AI system with intelligent routing between Gemini (with web search), DeepSeek R1, and Cloudflare AI
- 5-level fallback system ensuring 99.9% AI response availability
- Vector memory system using Pinecone for persistent conversation context
- Automatic web search integration for Gemini responses requiring current information

**Music System Architecture**:
- Multiple Lavalink node configuration with automatic failover
- Support for YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud platforms
- Advanced audio codec system with quality filters and equalizers
- Regional optimization with 8+ public Lavalink nodes

**Database Design**:
- Primary: PostgreSQL for core data persistence
- Cache Layer: Redis for session management and rate limiting
- Vector Storage: Pinecone for AI memory and semantic search
- Local Storage: SQLite for specific functionality

**Moderation Framework**:
- Dual AutoMod system (Discord native + custom implementation)
- Intelligent content filtering with real-time processing
- Comprehensive role management and permission system
- Integrated ticket system with automated workflows

**Multimodal Processing**:
- Advanced content detection system for text, image, and audio
- OCR capabilities with multiple fallback engines
- Audio transcription and analysis
- Image analysis using Gemini Vision with multiple providers

### Technical Implementation Details
**Command Structure**: Exclusively slash commands (`/`) with comprehensive error handling and user feedback

**Personality System**: Consistent kawaii personality across all interactions using pastel emojis (ðŸŒ¸âœ¨ðŸ’–ðŸ¥ºðŸ’«) with Spanish language preference and timid conversational style

**Rate Limiting & Resilience**: Circuit breaker pattern implementation with intelligent rate limit management and bucket tracking to prevent API exhaustion

**Response Management**: Intelligent text truncation system handling Discord's 2000 character limit with graceful degradation and kawaii error messages

**Cooldown Systems**: User-specific cooldowns (30s AI, 10s social) with administrative override capabilities
